# Lab 7: Signal Transformations and Operations

## Objectives:
- Understand and implement fundamental signal operations
- Compare continuous-time vs discrete-time signal representations
- Apply time shifting, scaling, and reversal transformations
- Visualise signal transformations using subplots
- Work with piecewise-defined signals and mathematical functions

## Exercise Completed:
- Signal Types: Sine wave, linear slope, constant function
- Operations: Time shift, scaling, reversal
- Visualization: 2Ã—4 subplot grid comparing all transformations
